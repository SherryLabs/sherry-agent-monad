This is useful for:\n- Gradual token distribution\n- Rewards programs\n- Expanding supply based on demand\n\nüî• **Burnable tokens** allow tokens to be permanently destroyed/removed from circulation. Benefits include:\n- Reducing total supply over time\n- Deflationary economics\n- Buy-back-and-burn mechanisms\n\nYou can implement either or both in your token.
